# Roman Mednitzer — Public Profile (OSINT-free)

Files:
- `index.html` — condensed, employer-agnostic profile (city-level only) with embedded JSON-LD.
- `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml` — search discoverability.
- `.well-known/security.txt` — RFC 9116 contact policy.
- `.nojekyll` — ensures `/.well-known/` is served on GitHub Pages.

Deploy:
1) Push these files to `rmednitzer.github.io` (or any static host) and enable GitHub Pages on `main`.
2) Adjust the canonical URL in `index.html` and `sitemap.xml` if you host under a custom domain.
3) Keep private details out of this repo (no phone, address, or day-level dates).
